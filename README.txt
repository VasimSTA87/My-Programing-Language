There are two settings in the Program.cs file: debug mode and test mode.
In debug mode, the program will display a list of tokens and their values.
In test mode, the program will run a text file from the Example folder, note the path to the test file is on my PC, change it to use test mode.
To use my programming language you will need Notepad++ to run in the options specify the path to the built .exe file and after a space add "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" and you are done!
